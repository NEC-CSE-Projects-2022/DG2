## Abstract
This project presents an adaptive Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that integrates advanced preprocessing techniques with hybrid deep learning models to improve cyberattack detection. The CICIDS2017 dataset is preprocessed using data cleaning, Min-Max normalization, SMOTEENN for class balancing, and Boruta feature selection for dimensionality reduction.

Four deep learning models—Autoencoder, GRU, AlexNet, and MiniVGGNet—are implemented and evaluated. The Autoencoder achieved the highest performance with 99.67% accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of hybrid feature selection and deep learning integration for intrusion detection.

## Our Improvement Over Existing Paper
❌ Replaced traditional signature-based IDS with deep learning-based detection.

⚖️ Solved class imbalance using SMOTEENN instead of DSSTE.

🎯 Applied Boruta feature selection to remove redundant and irrelevant features.

🧠 Integrated both unsupervised (Autoencoder) and supervised (GRU, CNNs) models.

🔄 Improved zero-day attack detection using Autoencoder reconstruction loss.

📈 Achieved higher accuracy compared to traditional ML models like XGBoost and LSTM.
